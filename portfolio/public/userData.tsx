        text: "I'm Grant, my development journey started 7 years ago. While I was a sophomore in high school, I taught myself how to build web scrapers with python. Since then, i've helped hundreds of people scale their income with my programs. I've provided checkout automation software, monitors, product scrapers, and much more to several discord groups. The amount of success and growth ive seen from members and myself is astronomical. During that time, I also attended community college for an associates in Information Technology. Aside from creating applications, I enjoy building robots for real world application, traveling, and working out at the gym."

I reversed engineered Cloudflare v1 and eventually v2 which made my bot fast and limited user's proxies from being banned. Flow served us well, it would take stock like it wasn't even there. My bot and monitors helped the group make well over $50,000."
